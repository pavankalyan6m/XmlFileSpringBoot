Project Title: Spring Boot XML File Reader and Writer API

Description: This project is a Spring Boot API that reads an XML file from a local computer directory, prints its content to the console, and allows you to save the data to another XML file when requested through a POST API endpoint. It demonstrates the ability to read and write XML data and can be customized for various XML file operations.

Key Features:

1. Read XML File: The API allows you to specify the file path as a parameter to read XML files located on your local computer.

2. Print to Console: The API prints the content of the XML file to the console for easy debugging and verification.

3. Write XML Data: A POST API endpoint enables you to save the data from the XML file to another XML file located on your local computer.

How to Use:

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.

2. Configure the project in your preferred Java IDE or build it using Maven.

3. Place your XML files in a directory on your local computer.

4. Run the Spring Boot application.

5. Use an API testing tool like Postman to send a GET request to `http://localhost:8080/read-xml` with the `filePath` parameter set to the absolute path of your source XML file.

6. The API will read the XML file and print its content to the console.

7. Use a POST request with the `sourceFilePath` and `targetFilePath` parameters to save the data to another XML file.

Sample XML Content (Indian Cricketers):

For testing purposes, you can use sample XML data like this:

xml file: 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<indianCricketers>
    <player>
        <name>Virat Kohli</name>
        <role>Captain</role>
        <age>32</age>
    </player>
    <player>
        <name>Rohit Sharma</name>
        <role>Vice Captain</role>
        <age>34</age>
    </player>
    <!-- Add more cricketers here -->
</indianCricketers>

Troubleshooting:

If you encounter issues such as "Failed to read the XML file," consider the following:

- Verify the file path is correct.
- Ensure the file exists and has the necessary permissions.
- Check for proper error handling in the code.

Notes:

- This project is intended for local testing and should not be used in a production environment without proper security and validation mechanisms.

- Ensure that the POST request includes both the source file path (to read) and the target file path (to write). Use "sourceFilePath" and "targetFilePath" as parameter names when making the POST request.
